RETIMI is a set of python scripts for tranlsting a REal-Time system
to a formal automaton model that can be analysed with IMITATOR.

To run the program you need to have a txt file that specifies the
system you want to analyse. An example can be found in file example.txt

An example is:

   python generator.py example.txt

This will generate file example.imi and run imitator on in. 
The program expects that the exec file of imitaror is found in the 
parent directory of where the program is launched.
